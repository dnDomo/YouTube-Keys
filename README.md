# YouTube-Keys
A very simple userscript to auto focus on the YouTube HTML5 video player as soon as it can, to make the YouTube keyboard shortcuts work correctly. If the player somehow loses focus it refocuses automatically, provided the user is not trying to type into and input or textarea element.
